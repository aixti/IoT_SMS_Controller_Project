# IoT SMS Controller Project 🚀

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is an IoT-based SMS control and monitoring system using PIC16F877A microcontroller and SIM300 GSM module.  
It allows users to remotely control electrical devices via SMS commands and receive alerts when:
- The temperature exceeds the set threshold.
- Unauthorized intrusion is detected.

Developed by **Trương Thanh Tuấn**, during my graduation thesis at **Trường Cao đẳng Kỹ thuật Cao Thắng**, majoring in Electronics and Telecommunications, class of 2008–2011.
